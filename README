Simple chat program designed to show Ricart–Agrawala mutual exclusion algorithm.

Install dependencies with npm install and run with nodejs index.js.

Obtain help with /help command.

You can change some settings in config.ini

Implementation details:
- Program communicates over UDP sockets. Packets targeted to all nodes use multicast otherwise unicast is used.
- Neighbor discovery works automatically (including dead neighbor pruning).
- Program implements Lampart logical clock and shows this timestamp before event messages. Event timestamps show the local logical clock when the event was fired (packet received, message sent...).
- Program implements Ricart–Agrawala mutual exclusion algorithm with Roucairol-Carvalho optimization

Warning. Program asumes that the network delivers all packets. It WILL break on regular (imperfect) network.
